    OpenAPI 2.0 has a built-in limitation on paths. Only one operation can be mapped to a path and http method. There are some APIs, however, where multiple distinct operations are mapped to the same path and same http method. For example GET /mypath/query-drive?op=file and GET /mypath/query-drive?op=folder may return two different model types (stream in the first example and JSON model representing Folder in the second). Since OpenAPI does not treat query parameters as part of the path the above 2 operations may not co-exist in the standard "paths" element.

    To overcome this limitation an "x-ms-paths" extension was introduced parallel to "paths". URLs under "x-ms-paths" are allowed to have query parameters for disambiguation, however they are not actually used.
