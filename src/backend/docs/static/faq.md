## 1. What's the difference between Autorest.az and AAZDev Tool?
---
Autorest.az was used to generate CLI command code. However it relies on autorest framework, which is designed to SDK generation.
So the model used in autorest framework are design for SDK not for CLI commands. And the commands generated by autorest.az deeply rely on SDK.

Another difference is that, the configuration of Autorest.az is hard to use. Developer need to write the changes in configuration files. And because autorest is a pipeline with tens of plugins, so developer need to write different configurations for different plugins, that's very hard to use.
AAZDev tool use declarative configuration because the model used in it is designed for CLI commands instead SDK.

## 2. Does AAZDev support data-plane APIs?
---
Not Yet. Currently the AAZDev tool is focus on Management-plane APIs. However, the framework of AAZDev is designed to support Data-plane APIs. As we know data-plane APIs are much different cross resource providers. So we plane to support them case by case.
